## About AB Test Web

AB Testing is hard, 
launching features for selective group of customers, 
merchant and different localities is hard, specially when your codebase grows.
This is an approach to solve it for SMEs, where we will be adding features, 
which later will be cached to REDIS for higher performance. 
It will require accessors for other packages. I'll put all the codes how we will implement and you be the judge if it suits your needs.

## Design Approach

- Using sqlite for authentication and features
- Using REDIS to store features and treatments.

## Enhancements

We can add metrics and fatals to check if and when users are crashing.
